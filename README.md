# haskell-chess

Simple, CLI-playable chess-engine.

This is a work in progress. For now, it features only an engine that tries to
take you as many pieces as possible (including your king), implemented the
alpha-beta algorithm.

## Features to be implemented:
(*) /en passant/ capturing, castling, pawn promotion;
(*) prevent the user from putting themselves in check;
(*) handle endgames properly by detecting draw and checkmate.
